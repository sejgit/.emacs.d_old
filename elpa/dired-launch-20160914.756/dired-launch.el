;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a launcher for the Emacs dired-mode.
;; In a nutshell, it lets you select a file and then launch an
;; external application with that file.

;; To enable, add `dired-launch-mode' to `dired-mode-hook'.  For
;; convenience, the command `dired-launch-enable' will do this for
;; you.
